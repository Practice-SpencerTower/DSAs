# Heaps

- a category of trees
- what applies to trees applies to heaps
- many types of heaps

## Binary Heaps

- both child nodes must be less than that of the parent
- every child node is smaller than the root node
- binary - each parent has at least two child nodes
- left children are always filled out first
- no implied ordering/relationship between siblings (as you would see in a binary tree)
- useful for priority queues
  - assigns an importance level to each item in the queue
- often used to assist with graph traversal
