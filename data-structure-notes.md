# Data Structure Notes - General

- Different data structures excel in different cases
- Some more specialized, some more general
- Each store the same values but have different relationships between the data stored as well as different functionality
- Useful in real world, not just for interviews

- Creating Data Structures with Classes:
  - Class syntax is "syntactic sugar" over JS's existing prototype-based inheritance
  - The "class" keyword basically allows you to implement OOP in JS
  - "constructor" method assigns values to the new instance
  - Instance methods
    - Used to add functionality to instances of a class
  - Class methods
    - Uses 'static' keyword to define a static method for a class - Called without instantiating the class
    - Cannot be called via a class instance
    - Used to create 'utility' functions - does not relate to an individual class - part of the class in general
