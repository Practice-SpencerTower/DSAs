# Single Cycle Check

- AlgoExpert

- Can be done in O(n) Time and O(1) Space

- If we visited more than one element and we end up back at 0 / stargin point, then there is not a single cycle
- Want to visit n elements - n = length of array
- If we have looped through n elements and are NOT back at the starting point, then there is not a single cycle
