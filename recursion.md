# Recursion

## Notes: Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass by Colt Steel

## Common Recursion Pitfalls

- Not having a base case
  - Without a base case the recursive function will continue indefinitely, and reach the call stack limit / stack overflow

- No return statement or returning the wrong thing
  - Need a return statement in the recursive call and the base case

## Helper Method Recursion

- An outer and inner function
  - Inner function calls itself recursively
  - Useful for collecting values in an array
