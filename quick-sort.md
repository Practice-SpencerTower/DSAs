# Quick Sort

## Notes: Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass by Colt Steel

- Similar to merge sort in that it utilizes the fact that arrays with 0 or 1 elements are already sorted
- Selects a single element to be the "pivot", used to fint the index where the pivot should be in the sorted array
- Once pivot is placed, quick sort can be applied to either side of the pivot
