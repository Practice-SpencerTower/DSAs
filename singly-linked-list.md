# Singly Linked Lists

## Notes: Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass by Colt Steel

- What are singly linked lists?
  - Ordered data structure
  - Different from array in that it does not have incides
    - No random access
  - Each element points to the next one
  - Have to start at the beginning of the list and traverse to get to a specific value in the list
